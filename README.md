# Network optimization
The aim of this project is to implement a network routing protocol using the data structures and algorithms we have studied in class. The main purpose is to solve the MAX-BANDWIDTH_PATH problem, which is to find a path of the maximum bandwidth between two vertices on two different graphs using three algorithms which are Dijkstra’s algorithm without using a heap structure, Dijkstra’s algorithm using a heap structure for fringes and Kruskal’s algorithm, in which the edges are sorted by HeapSort.  
####
To run the project, input "python Test.py x y z"   
x=1 represents graph1 with average degree6  
x=2 represents graph2 with each vertex adjacent to 20% of other vertices  
y is the pairs of source and destination vertex you want to test  
z is the number of graph you want to generate
